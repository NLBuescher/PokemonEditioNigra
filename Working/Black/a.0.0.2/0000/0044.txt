Hi there!{CLEAR}

Welcome to the world of Pokémon!{CLEAR}


My name is Professor Juniper.
Everyone calls me the Pokémon Professor!{CLEAR}


That's right! This world is widely
inhabited by mysterious creatures{ADDLINE}
called Pokémon!{CLEAR}


Pokémon have mysterious powers.
They come in many shapes{ADDLINE}
and live in many different places.{CLEAR}

We humans live happily with Pokémon!
Living and working together,{ADDLINE}
we complement each other.{CLEAR}

We help each other out to
accomplish difficult tasks.{CLEAR}

Having Pokémon battle one another
is particularly popular, and it deepens{ADDLINE}
the bonds between people and Pokémon.{ADDLINE}
And that is why I research Pokémon.{CLEAR}


Well, that's enough from me...
Could you tell me about yourself?{CLEAR}


Are you a boy?
Or a girl?{CLEAR}


You're a boy, right?{CLEAR}


You're a girl, right?{CLEAR}

Well then. I'm going to introduce you
to your two best friends!{CLEAR}


This young man is Cheren.{CLEAR}

He can be a little difficult, but
he's a very honest person.{CLEAR}


This young woman is Bianca.{CLEAR}

She's a little flighty,
but she works very hard.{CLEAR}


I think you three have potential,
so I'm going to give you{ADDLINE}
a very, very important Pokémon.{CLEAR}


{NAME}!{CLEAR}

The moment you choose the
Pokémon that will accompany{ADDLINE}
you on your journey,{ADDLINE}
your story will truly begin.{CLEAR}

During your journey, you will meet many
Pokémon and people with different{ADDLINE}
personalities and points of view!{CLEAR}

to you in all of these travels...{CLEAR}
